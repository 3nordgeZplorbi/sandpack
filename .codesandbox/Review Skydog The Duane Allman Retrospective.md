Duane Allman was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 20, 1946. He was the elder son of Willis Allman, a World War II veteran who was killed by a hitchhiker in 1949, and Geraldine Allman, who raised Duane and his younger brother Gregg as a single mother. [^1^] Duane was inspired by blues and rock music at an early age, and started playing the guitar when he was 14. He and Gregg formed several bands together, such as the Escorts, the Allman Joys, and the Hour Glass, but none of them achieved much success. [^1^] [^2^]
 
In 1968, Duane moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he became a sought-after session musician for Atlantic Records. He played with legendary artists like Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, King Curtis, and Boz Scaggs, and earned the nickname "Skydog" for his soaring guitar solos. [^1^] [^2^] He also met Eric Clapton, who invited him to join his new band Derek and the Dominos. Duane played on their landmark album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, which featured his famous slide guitar on songs like "Layla" and "Bell Bottom Blues". [^1^] [^3^]
 
Meanwhile, Duane had also formed his own band with Gregg and four other musicians: Dickey Betts on guitar, Berry Oakley on bass, and Jai Johanny Johanson and Butch Trucks on drums. The Allman Brothers Band blended blues, rock, jazz, and country influences into a unique style that became known as Southern rock. They released their self-titled debut album in 1969, followed by Idlewild South in 1970. They gained a loyal fan base for their live performances, which featured long improvisational jams and dual guitar harmonies. In 1971, they recorded their breakthrough album At Fillmore East, which captured their live energy and showcased Duane's virtuosity. [^1^]
 
However, Duane's life was cut short on October 29, 1971, when he crashed his motorcycle into a truck in Macon, Georgia. He died at the age of 24, leaving behind a legacy of music that influenced generations of guitarists and fans. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 with the Allman Brothers Band. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, ranking second on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists in 2003. His guitar tone, achieved with a Gibson Les Paul and two Marshall amplifiers, is considered one of the best ever by Guitar Player magazine. His passion for music and his ability to inspire others are also remembered by those who knew him and loved him. [^1^]
